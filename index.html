            <p class="mb-5">Sethe: She is the assumed protagonist of the story; however, other people have argued Denver is actually the protagonist. Sethe does not remember much of her past especially before Sweet Home, a plantation that she worked on and met her husband, Halle Suggs. The name of the plantation, Sweet Home, is ironic based on her troubling experience at that plantation. She’s reminded of the sweet things and the unsweet things at Sweet Home. She eventually escaped, but she was still traumatized by being a slave. Therefore, when she had her children, she tried to kill them when the plantation owner, schoolteacher, tries to take her back. In the beginning of the story, her life is stagnant and essentially uneventful. She has cut off communication with everyone except Denver. Her life has been full of sadness and loneliness because she was a slave, and family members were often sold separately. Therefore, as a slave she could never have that ideal dream of having a family. Everyone who she had prior contact to essentially “left” her ranging from Halle, Bulgar, Howard, Baby Suggs, and Beloved (initially). She doesn’t want to connect, but Paul D. comes. She begins her path of accepting herself and her child, Beloved. She’s finally able to open up again and feel vulnerable.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">Beloved: No one really knows for sure who she actually is especially in the end of the story. However, in the house of 124, she changes up the dynamic and threatens the stability of the house. Her mother, Sethe, finds love with Paul D, but Beloved comes in to create tension. Beloved, Denver, and Sethe love and protect each other. However, as the story goes on, it becomes more apparent that “Beloved” is using her mother. Her mother’s health deteriorates due to Beloved. Denver realizes this and tries to protect her mother, and in the end it’s a win and a loss. Her mother is heartbroken that she is once again unable to care for Beloved and be there for her. Beloved may be physically an adult, but she is still a child at heart. The things she says and does is reminiscent of a child, and it makes the reader constantly question if it’s actually Beloved. Beloved was initially a ghost haunting the house of 124, but she became someone who they could physically interact with.</p>

            <p class="mb-5">Denver: One could argue that she is the main character of the story. In the beginning of the story, the reader can infer she is a young adult unready to deal with life’s challenges. She doesn’t know much about her mother’s past, and she is terribly lonely. She doesn’t have anyone to talk to except for her mother and Beloved. She also hates Paul D (in the beginning at least) because she felt Paul D was becoming a barrier between her and her mother. However, as the story goes on, she increasingly changes and becomes more accepting of Paul D. She sees that Paul D. is someone necessary to help her mother, Sethe, move on. Denver enjoys the time she had when Beloved had a physical appearance because now it was someone who can be physically held and interact with. In the later chapters when she explains her point of view, it’s an incredibly powerful moment in which she is different from her past. She becomes a strong independent women who is not the person being protected but rather the one protecting.</p>

He also knows her husband since he was a slave and worked together. Paul D himself also grows from the experience of being with the family at 124. He has closed off his heart due to his troubling experience in the past. He doesn’t want to feel pain anymore but rather wants happiness. However, at 124, his “tin can heart” finally starts to open. He allows himself to be vulnerable, and Beloved took advantage of that. She wanted to separate Sethe and Paul D. When he learns about the story of Sethe’s past, he’s forced to confront his past. His past wrongdoings, who he actually is, and is forced to accept himself. Eventually, he says to himself that he’s going to try and have a life with Sethe and the family. </p>

She was also a former slave until her son, Halle Suggs, bought her freedom himself. She accepts it because of what it means for him. As a freed slave, she herself changes to become someone who extends her help to others. She becomes support for many slaves and former slaves. She gives them hope that maybe one day they don’t have to endure the hardships anymore. However, happy moments are ephemeral, because jealousy and hate start to arise from the community. No one accepts her anymore or wants her help, because they think that she thinks she is better than everyone else around her. She doesn’t think that way but just wanted to help others. In the end, she helped many people but was never recognized for it.</p>

            <img class="img-fluid mb-5" src="img/portfolio/submarine.png" alt="">
            <p class="mb-5">General Symbolism: The most common symbol is Paul D.’s “tin heart” which is described often in the book. It’s something that many other characters feel especially Sethe and Denver. Denver feels lonely, her heart is hollow. She wants friends, and she still relies on others for support. The only thing that’s keeping her from fully closing her “tin heart” was Beloved and her mother. It offered a small glimpse of hope for her loneliness. Throughout the story, her tin heart starts to open up more to those around her such as Paul D. She no longer views Paul D as a threat to her relationship to her mother, but rather an addition to the family. Sethe, perhaps a character that might have suffered the most. She doesn’t have a lot of memories of her before Sweet Home, but she remembers glimpse of her past. Sweet Home was anything but a sweet home. She was treated in a humiliating way when schoolteacher took her milk which was for her child. It was perhaps one of the worst things that can happen to someone. To make matters worse, she’s forced to kill her children so that they don’t have to experience slavery like she did. There were consequences, however, such as how Bulgar and Howard left because they were scared of her. Her husband disappeared and so does Baby Suggs. She does not have anyone to motivate her anymore and essentially has a tin heart. However, Paul D. comes and Beloved to reinvigorate the passion and hopes that she once had. She can finally have a complete family. Paul D. himself has a tin heart also. He has thrown away any chance of love, because it has hurt him before. Pain is a powerful feeling in which he doesn’t want to experience anymore. He had enough of that feeling. He meets Sethe and reconnects with her, someone who he can finally talk to and maybe relate to. Paul D. then meets Beloved who tries to force his tin heart open, to feel emotions once again. He finally breaks and tries to piece himself back together at a church. He comes back stronger and with a stronger resolve to be with Sethe and have a family with her. All these main characters had some sort of tin, hollow heart that was opened by one another in which they had to expose their vulnerable side. Through the experience, they became stronger from their former self and also less apathetic. </p>
